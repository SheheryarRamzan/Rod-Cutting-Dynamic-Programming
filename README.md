House Price Land Size Compartmentalization

The "House Price Land Size Compartmentalization" project addresses the challenge of determining optimal house prices based on different land sizes using dynamic programming techniques. The goal is to assist real estate agents and property buyers in making informed decisions by providing a data-driven approach to estimating property values.

Using a Python-based dynamic programming solution, the application can efficiently compute the maximum obtainable price for houses with varying land sizes. The algorithm optimizes the valuation process by compartmentalizing the data into different categories of land sizes.

Key Features:

Dynamic Programming Approach: The project employs dynamic programming principles to efficiently solve the rod-cutting problem, maximizing the obtainable house prices for each land size category.

C++ Implementation: The algorithm is implemented using C++, ensuring a versatile and adaptable solution for various scenarios.

Data-driven Valuation: The application allows users to input relevant data, such as house details and corresponding land sizes, to compute optimal prices.

Customization: The solution can be tailored to accommodate specific market conditions and preferences, providing flexibility for different regions and property types.

The "House Price Land Size Compartmentalization" project streamlines the valuation of properties, empowering stakeholders to make well-informed decisions and maximize their investments. By leveraging dynamic programming techniques and Python implementation, the application offers an efficient and data-driven approach to address compartmentalization challenges in the real estate domain.

4. Not applicable. Space complexity is O(n) and cannot be optimized further. Because before 
computing every result we need to know all the smaller results. 
5. Time complexity of a bottom-up iterative algorithm: Takes linear time to solve for each value of 
n, so total time complexity is θ(n2
). The analysis of the bottom-up code is simple. We are using 
nested loops; the first loop is iterating from j=1 to size and the second loop is iterating from i=0
to j (j ranging from 1 to n). So, it will result in Θ(n2
) time.
6. All requirements are met! The code is generic too.
